It is a movement that encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing.\nVarious tools and best practices have been developed to support the open science culture, enabling scientists to work more openly and reproducibly.\nNMFS Openscapes is a program that offers team-based training opportunities, empowering the NMFS staff with the skills and tools to contribute to the open science landscape effectively.\nThis page serves as a collaborative space for the SWFSC participants of the NMFS Openscapes to share knowledge, insights and experiences gained from the program to foster inclusive and collaborative culture at SWFSC.",
